ABOUT ME

A SHORT BLURB
I first chose Software Engineering on a whim because Teachers and Parents said my logical brain would suit it. Now I have done more work in the sector, I’ve found that the assignments and projects I am given are easy to understand.

EXPERIENCE (at the moment)
Currently in my courses I am: designing and coding a text-based version of Cluedo; examining ancient encryption methods using C; writing a literature review on the Colonization of Mars; and discussing the security requirements for a defenseless coke machine.

ROLE FIT
The experiences I’ve gained while at University have helped develop various skills including Time Management, Logical Thinking, and Organisation. Because of the many group projects which I’ve completed, with both reliable and unreliable teammates, I have improved in my Team Cooperation and, when I was the only one who had really understood the question given to us, my Leadership.
